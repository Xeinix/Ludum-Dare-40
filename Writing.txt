2D Platformer game, where your main goal is to avoid
rocks and other objects while going through some type
of course so that you don't slow down and run out of
energy.

Dream clouds idea where you have to pick up certian 
items to complete the level. But arround and near these
items there are also objects that cause you not to be
able to fly as high. Causing you to hit into a barrier.
Lose. And have to restart.
